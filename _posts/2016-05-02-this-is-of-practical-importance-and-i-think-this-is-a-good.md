This is of practical importance. And I think this is a good place to throw all ideas. They will hopefully turn into a beautiful form that can be attended with pleasure.

The practical concern is to figure out the first link at vitalzone.org.

Right now the link I have created seems to be vague and not helpful for navigating the visitor to the next page.

It should be speaking to some one who soon after coming to the home page is convinced and wants to go further. Then rambling into why going further is like killing the initiative. Or, saying this should be interesting enough.

The challenge is to figure out what will be optimum there.

The link reads "The Self Healing Advantage". Content should be smart and true to this. Sharing this advantage in a super acceptable way!

What is behind the human violence which has become a real danger for survival of this planet? Isn't what we see in the society and accuse others for begins in our own minds? It seems to be the natural byproduct of how mind works. Conventional mind is dominated by thoughts. 

Looking at one's own stream of thoughts, you can easily see how a thought is never whole. It is a fragment that refers to something in the past and projects something in the future as its continuity trail. Thus a thought is not a wholesome business. 

It is a movement of a fragmentary material. And all the fragments fight with each other. Each one trying to dominate over the other. That is what we call control. But if you are watchful, you can see that this control keeps the divisive circus going. Whole society is suffering from this. The inner thing spills outside in the society. And then we try to control it with more measures created by the same instrument that can create only divisions. 

Is there an end to it? Yes, if you do not believe in the illusion of controller and controlled. But that is where the whole human race is tied. How does one live in a world that knows nothing beside this violent way of living? 

Behind all this, there seems to be an unspoken assumption. A belief that you can not make an optimum response unless you are thinking. This is false. There are many everyday examples that prove that you do not need thoughts to be alive and wise in the moment. On the contrary, thoughts distract your perception in its subject of occupation. That becomes the cause of many accidents. Who does not know it?
